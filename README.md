Designed and developed an advanced driver monitoring system aimed at detecting drowsiness and fatigue in drivers in real-time. The system utilizes eye closure patterns to analyze the driver's blinking behavior, distinguishing between normal eye blinks and signs of drowsiness. By identifying subtle changes in the eye's movement, the system can effectively detect drowsiness while driving, providing timely alerts to prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue.
